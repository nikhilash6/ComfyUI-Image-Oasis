# Image Oasis

Part of the **Oasis Suite** (this pack). Node class id: `ImageOasis`.
Frontend: [`../web/image_oasis.js`](../web/image_oasis.js). Suite overview: [root README](../README.md).


An all-in-one ComfyUI image generation node. One node replaces the multi-Switch
graph: pick an architecture, point at a model, prompt, get a finished image -
with an optional prompt enhancer, refiner pass, and upscale.

## What it does in one node

* **Tri-source model loading**: checkpoint / diffusion (unet) / GGUF
* **Architecture switching** via a dropdown (a capability *registry* replaces
every "Switch (Any)" node): AuraFlow, Boogu-Image 0.1 (Base / Turbo),
Flux.1 / Flux.2, Krea 2 (Turbo / Raw), Qwen-Image-Edit,
SD1 / SD1.5 / No Patch (the SDXL/SD1.x escape hatch), SD3 / SD3.5
* **Architecture-correct model-sampling patch** (ModelSamplingFlux /
DiscreteFlow with the right multiplier), with arch-default shift values
* **Per-architecture CLIP slots** - single, dual, or triple, automatically
surfaced based on the chosen architecture (Flux gets 2, SD3/3.5 gets 3,
AuraFlow/Krea 2/Qwen gets 1, etc.). Mixed safetensors + GGUF CLIPs are supported
through `ComfyUI-GGUF`'s `DualCLIPLoaderGGUF`/`TripleCLIPLoaderGGUF`
* **LoRA stack**: any number of LoRAs applied to model + CLIP in order, each with
its own model/CLIP strength and an optional trigger-words field that auto-
prepends to your prompt - works over GGUF UNets as well as safetensors;
drag the 9-dot grip to reorder
* **Conditioning** that branches automatically: plain CLIP text encode, or
TextEncodeQwenImageEditPlus with up to 3 reference images (upload *or*
drag-and-drop) when the architecture supports it
* **VAE-derived latent** (correct channel count / compression per model), with
aspect-ratio presets (1:1, 2:3, 3:4, 9:16, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2), ratio-locked
width/height editing, a swap button, and a Fit Method (Stretch / Crop / Pad)
that controls how incoming images - the img2img init or the Qwen edit
references - are conformed to the output size
* **Img2img on every non-Qwen architecture**: drop an image into the Init slot
and generation starts from it instead of noise - the model remakes your image
in its own style, carrying structure, composition, and palette. Denoise is
the strength dial (start ~0.5). Occupied slot = enabled; clear it to return
to txt2img
* **Ref image info**: every occupied reference/init slot shows the image's
resolution and file size, with a one-click button that sets the latent
width/height to match the source
* **Refiner pass (img2img-style)**: optional second sampling pass over the base
result. The base runs to full denoise, then the refiner re-noises to
`refiner_denoise` strength and runs its own steps - the "second KSampler at
partial denoise" pattern, independent of the base schedule
* **Optional upscale**: algorithmic or spandrel model upscale with OOM-fallback
tiling
* **Low-VRAM resilience**: VAE decode falls back to tiled decoding on
out-of-memory instead of failing after a completed sampling run, and known
architecture-breaking startup flags (Krea 2 + `--use-sage-attention`) are
refused up front with a clear error instead of producing silent black images
* **Krea 2 conditioning rebalance, built in**: Krea 2's 12-layer text
conditioning under-weights the deep layers that carry fine detail and
identity; the node automatically reweights them (RMS-renormalized so overall
strength is unchanged) as part of the architecture's encode path. No control
to set - it just generates better. Note this means Krea 2 seeds from v1.3
render slightly differently in v1.4
* **Variety control** for the "every seed looks the same" problem on
distilled models: a single dial that adds tiny seeded noise to the prompt
conditioning during the early sampling steps, so re-rolling the seed
produces genuinely different compositions while prompt adherence and detail
stay faithful. 0 = off, fully seed-reproducible
* **Prompt enhancer ("magic wand")**: expand a short prompt into a detailed one
with a local LLM - see below
* **Presets**: save, reload, and drag-to-reorder named configurations
* **On-node output**: the generated image renders in the node's right-hand pane,
with a save-to-output button, randomize-seed-and-generate dice, an interrupt
button while a run is live, an A/B **compare slider** (current vs. previous,
or current vs. any reference/init slot), and left/right arrows for navigating
batches - all available without keeping the Generation group open
* **History strip** under the output pane: recall, save, and load-from-output
for the session's previous results
* **Per-LoRA CivitAI lookup** (by file hash, straight to the model page) and a
**Bypass Node / Activate Node** footer under the left column
* **Custom theme** (six CSS variables, named theme presets, live propagation
across every Image Oasis node in the workflow)
* **In-node help panel** that renders `image_oasis_help_content.md` inline, so the
reference text lives next to the controls it describes

## What it deliberately does not do

Image Oasis is self-contained by design, and some things stay out of it on
purpose rather than by omission:

* **Masking and inpainting** - out of scope for this node. Region-targeted
work belongs in a dedicated workflow; for prompt-driven edits, use the
Qwen-Image-Edit architecture's reference slots instead.
* **ControlNet** - lives in **Control Architect** (a separate node pack, not
part of this suite), and is not planned here.
* **A companion node** - not planned. Everything the node needs rides inside
it; feeding an output back in is a drag onto the Img2Img Init slot.

## What's new in v1.5

v1.5 is the **Oasis Suite** release - Image Oasis now ships alongside Video
Oasis Viewer and LTX2.3 Oasis in one pack (see the [root README](../README.md)),
and the whole pack moved to **GPL-3.0-or-later**. Image Oasis itself gained:

* **History strip** under the output pane - the image-appropriate subset of the
video scene-bar toolkit: click a thumbnail to recall a previous result, save
entries, load images from `output/`, and step through the session's history.
(No reorder - order is generation order.)
* **Per-LoRA CivitAI button** under each LoRA's strength field - looks the
file up **by hash**, so it lands on the exact model page rather than a
search-results list.
* **Bypass Node / Activate Node footer** fixed under the left column - same
mode-4 bypass behavior as rgthree's Fast Groups Bypasser, without leaving
the node.

## What's new in v1.4

* **Img2img on every non-Qwen architecture** via a new **Init** slot in the
Reference Images section. Occupied slot enables it, clearing it returns to
noise. Think image *inspiration* rather than editing: the model remakes your
image in its own style, carrying over structure, composition, and palette.
Denoise is the strength dial - start around 0.5. The Init slot has full
parity with the other slots (upload, drag-drop, paste, clear, compare-base).
* **Latent section** consolidating everything that shapes the canvas:
Width/Height with a ↔ swap, aspect-ratio presets (1:1, 2:3, 3:4, 9:16, 16:9,
4:3, 3:2) that lock the fields together on the nearest /16, a **Fit Method**
row, and Batch.
* **Fit Method** (Stretch / Crop / Pad) controlling how incoming images are
conformed to the latent size on *both* image paths: the img2img init image
on non-Qwen architectures, and the edit references on Qwen-Image-Edit -
which previously scaled references by its own internal policy. Crop is the
default; Pad fills leftover space with edge replication rather than black
bars.
* **Reference image info** - every occupied reference/init slot shows the
image's resolution and file size, with a one-click ⤢ button that sets the
latent Width/Height to the source dimensions (snapped to /16).
* **Interrupt button** (⏹) on the output header, visible only while a run is
in progress.
* **Boogu-Image 0.1 (Base / Turbo)** added as a first-class architecture, with
its own `boogu` CLIP type. Uses the Flux VAE and a Qwen3-VL-8B text encoder.
The Edit variant is not supported.
* **Krea 2 conditioning rebalance, built in.** Krea 2 conditions on 12 stacked
text-encoder layers, and alignment training under-weights the deep layers
that carry fine detail and identity; the node now reweights them as part of
the encode path, RMS-renormalized so overall conditioning strength is
unchanged. Always on, no control to set. Krea 2 seeds from v1.3 render
slightly differently as a result. Technique credit: nova452 and huwhitememes
(both Apache-2.0).
* **Variety control** in the Generation section for the "every seed looks the
same" problem on distilled models (Z-Image Turbo, Krea 2 Turbo, Boogu Turbo,
and similar). A single dial that adds tiny seeded noise to the prompt
conditioning during the early sampling steps, so re-rolling the seed
produces genuinely different compositions while prompt adherence and detail
stay faithful. 0 is off (default); start around 0.1. Same seed + same Variety
reproduces the same image.
* **Sage-attention fail-fast for Krea 2.** Krea 2 + `--use-sage-attention` used
to silently produce NaN latents (black images); the node now refuses the run
up front with a clear error naming the flag. Registry-driven, so future
arch/flag incompatibilities are a one-line addition.
* **NaN warning on the preview path** - corrupted latents reaching the preview
now print a loud warning naming the likely cause instead of being silently
clamped to a black image.
* **VAE decode falls back to tiled decoding on OOM** instead of failing after
the sampling work is already done.
* **Enhancer VRAM behavior tightened.** The diffusion model is no longer
evicted by passive events (adding a node, switching workflow tabs, changing
the enhancer model dropdown). Eviction happens only when Enhance is actually
clicked. Auto GPU layers are computed after that eviction against real free
VRAM, and the recommendation label updates to the layer count actually used.
Enhance is refused while an image is generating, and concurrent enhance
requests from multiple nodes are serialized instead of racing the loader.
* **Rerun overhead removed.** Reference and init images are content-hashed
through a stat-based memo and only loaded/decoded when a cache miss actually
needs to encode them, so a seed-only rerun costs a file stat per image
instead of a read, decode, and hash.
* **Architecture and CLIP type definitions served from the registry** to the
frontend, removing the last hand-synced frontend mirrors. Adding an image
architecture is now a registry-only change end to end.
* **Fixed** a v1.0-era bug where the plain text-encode path silently dropped
conditioning extras (attention mask, etc.) the text encoder attached. The
node now returns ComfyUI's full conditioning structure exactly like the
stock `CLIPTextEncode` node. This was fatal for Boogu-Image and subtly lossy
for other mask-emitting encoders (Qwen-Image, Krea 2) - conditioning for
those architectures now matches stock ComfyUI, so seeds may render slightly
differently than in earlier Image Oasis versions.
* **Fixed** a bug where the theme save routes reported success even when the
write to disk had failed, plus a batch of dead code and lint issues flagged
by the registry workflow.

## What's new in v1.3

* **Krea 2 (Turbo / Raw) added as a first-class architecture**, with a new
`krea2` CLIP type for Qwen3-VL-4B's 12-layer stacked hidden state. The 1.15
flow shift is baked into the model config, so no sampling patch is applied.
* **Note:** Krea 2 produces black images when ComfyUI is launched with
`--use-sage-attention`. Remove the flag when generating with Krea 2. Other
architectures are unaffected. (v1.4 turns this into a hard, up-front error.)

## What's new in v1.2

* **Prompt enhancer split into two boxes** - a sticky **User Prompt** (your short input)
and an **Enhanced Prompt** (the result, which drives generation). Re-clicking 
Enhance re-runs from the User Prompt every time, so iterating no longer 
overwrites your original.
* **Auto-cleanup profiles** - `profiles.json` strips model-specific output 
artifacts from enhancer results (`<think>` blocks, orphan `</think>` tags, 
leaked template tokens) without any user-facing toggle. Auto-resolved from 
the model filename, with a universal fallback. Edit the file to add rules 
for new models - no restart needed.
* **Enhancer Settings sub-panel** at the bottom of the Prompt section: Auto GPU 
layers with a live VRAM-based recommendation, manual GPU layers override, 
Context, Max tokens.
* **The enhancer LLM stays loaded between Enhance clicks** - re-enhancing is 
dramatically faster. It still unloads automatically when image generation 
starts, so it never competes with the diffusion model for VRAM during sampling.
* **Flash attention is now enabled by default** in the llama.cpp loader, for an 
additional inference speedup on CUDA / Metal builds.
* **Dropped:** the Think / No-think toggle (cleanup profiles handle thinking models 
now) and the revert button (no longer needed with the two-box flow).

## What's new in v1.1

* **Compare slider** in the output pane (`◧`) wipes between the current
generation and the previous one - perfect for "what did the refiner /
upscale actually do?" Toggle the same glyph on a reference image slot to
compare against that ref instead.
* **Batch navigation** - when a batch returns multiple images, `‹ N/M ›` in
the footer steps through them; the compare slider follows along per index.
* **Dual & triple CLIP** - extra `CLIP 2` / `CLIP 3` rows appear in the Model
section based on the architecture, so SDXL (dual) and SD3.5 (triple) work
without leaving the node.
* **In-node Help section** at the bottom of the control stack.
* **Preset reorder** - drag the 9-dot grip on any preset card to rearrange.
* **No more in-node live preview** rendering under the node body - the output
pane is the only thing that draws the image, so it can't fight the compare
slider or engulf the controls on certain ComfyUI builds.
* **Architecture dropdown reorganized & renamed** (alphabetical; "Other / No
Patch" became "SD1 / SD1.5 / No Patch" - and is the correct choice for
SDXL since SDXL is not flow-matching).
* Output-header buttons (Generate ▶, R&G 🎲, Compare ◧, Save 💾) unified into
four equal squares; the timer no longer jiggles as the milliseconds tick.
* **Failures are loud now.** A sampling error (e.g. out-of-VRAM) or a failed
architecture sampling patch stops the run and shows the real error on the
node, instead of silently producing a gray image - and a failed run is
never cached, so re-queuing actually retries.
* **Bounded model cache.** Cached models are kept for the 4 most-recently-run
node instances and evicted beyond that, so swapping between workflows all
day no longer creeps RAM upward until restart. A manual
`POST /image_oasis/flush_cache` clears everything immediately if you need
the RAM back mid-session.
* **The execution timer survives tab switches** - including mid-generation:
switch workflows while a run is live and the clock resumes from the true
elapsed time when you come back (validated against the server queue, so a
workflow saved mid-run can't resurrect a phantom timer).

## LoRA stack

The Model section has a **LoRAs** subsection where you can stack any number of
LoRAs. Each row is a LoRA file (from `ComfyUI/models/loras/`) plus a **model**
strength and a **CLIP** strength; "+ Add LoRA" adds rows and the ✕ removes them.
LoRAs are applied **in list order, top to bottom**, to both the model and CLIP
right after the model loads and before the sampling patch - so if two LoRAs
fight, reorder them rather than only lowering strengths.

* **Strength tweaks are cheap.** The loader caches the raw on-disk model
separately from the LoRA-patched layer, so changing a strength re-patches from
the cached base instead of re-reading the model from disk. Only changing the
model file itself triggers a full reload.
* **Trigger words per LoRA.** Each enabled LoRA row exposes a trigger-words
field. Whatever you type there gets prepended to the positive prompt at run
time, in stack order, comma-joined. Disabled LoRAs sit out. Empty fields are
skipped. The trigger string is part of the LoRA stack and rides along in
presets.
* **GGUF is supported.** LoRAs apply over GGUF-quantized UNets. The patched
layers give back some of the quantization's memory saving (expected, not a
bug), so VRAM ticks up slightly with a heavy stack.
* **The stack rides along in presets.** Saving a preset captures the LoRA list
and strengths as part of the reusable "look".
* **CivitAI button per LoRA.** Under each row's strength fields; hashes the
file and opens its exact CivitAI model page (no search-results guessing).
Nothing is sent anywhere until you click it.

## Reference images

The **Reference Images** section holds up to three slots, used by image-edit
architectures (e.g. Qwen-Image-Edit) and ignored by the rest. Fill a slot three
ways: click **Upload**, **drag an image onto the slot's image box** - from your
file manager, from another browser tab, or even from the node's own output pane
to iterate on a result - or **click the image box and paste (Ctrl+V)** an image
copied from anywhere (a website, a screenshot tool, another app). Dropped and
pasted images are copied into ComfyUI's input folder exactly like uploads, so
they behave identically downstream.

## Prompt enhancer (magic wand)

The Prompt section has a "magic wand" that expands a short prompt into a rich,
detailed one using a local GGUF LLM. It is **out-of-band**: it is not part of
the generation graph and the LLM never competes with the diffusion model for
VRAM during sampling.

### The two-box flow

* **User Prompt** - your short input. Sticky: it is not overwritten by an
enhancement, so re-clicking Enhance always re-runs from the same source.
* **Enhanced Prompt** - the LLM's expanded result. **This is what actually
drives generation.** It is overwritten on every Enhance click, so iterating
is just clicking Enhance again. You can also hand-edit it freely.

Pick a style with the toggle: **Natural Language** produces a flowing paragraph
(best for Flux, Qwen-Image-Edit, SD3); **Tags** produces a single line of
comma-separated positive tags (best for SDXL-style models).

### LLM lifetime

The model loads on the first Enhance click and **stays loaded between clicks**,
so re-enhancing is dramatically faster than the load+unload cycle of v1.1. It
unloads automatically at the start of the next image generation, so it never
holds VRAM during sampling. You don't manage this - it just happens.

### Auto cleanup (`profiles.json`)

Different LLMs leak different artifacts (a `<think>...</think>` reasoning
block, an orphan `</think>` tag, stray `[INST]` / `[OUT]` / `<<SYS>>` template
tokens, etc.). Image Oasis strips these automatically via `profiles.json`
beside `routes_enhance.py`: each profile has a `match` regex (against the
model filename) and a list of cleanup rules, and the first profile that
matches wins. A `universal` rule set runs if nothing matches. Rule edits take
effect on the **next click** - no ComfyUI restart needed. Power users can add
new profiles for new model families without touching code.

### Enhancer Settings (collapsed sub-panel at the bottom of the Prompt section)

* **Auto GPU layers** (checkbox, on by default). When on, the enhancer reads
the GGUF header for layer count, queries free VRAM, and computes how many
layers fit on the GPU after a safety reserve - shown in the **Recommended:**
label next to the checkbox (`All (N)` when the whole model fits, `K/N`
otherwise). The computation evicts the diffusion model first, so the
reading reflects what will actually be available at enhance time.
* **GPU layers** - manual override, only editable when Auto is off. `-1` =
all on GPU. Don't disable Auto unless you know what you're doing - an
over-aggressive manual value will OOM the load; the enhancer retries on
CPU as a backstop, but you'll have given up the GPU speedup.
* **Context** and **Max tokens** - llama.cpp's `n_ctx` and the per-call
output cap. Defaults (8192 / 2048) cover the curated model set; raise
Context if you're using a longer-context model and want headroom.

### Enhancer setup

1. Install `llama-cpp-python` (see Optional dependencies below).
2. Put a GGUF LLM in `ComfyUI/models/LLM/`. It appears in the model dropdown.
3. Select it, pick a style (NL or Tags), type your User Prompt, click Enhance.

### Recommended enhancer model

Use an **abliterated Qwen3** GGUF - available in 4B, 8B, 14B, and 32B - at the
largest size + quant that fully fits your VRAM (for ~8 GB cards, 8B Q4_K_M is
a good sweet spot; more VRAM, go bigger or higher quant; under 8 GB, the 4B is
a clean fallback). Notes:

* **Abliterated / uncensored** is the part that matters most. A stock instruct
model will sanitize, soften, or refuse certain subjects *regardless of the
system prompt*. If enhancements come back euphemized or watered down, the
model is the cause, not the prompt - use an abliterated build.
* **Instruct or hybrid-thinking, both work.** Thinking models (Qwen3 / Qwen3.5)
burn output tokens on reasoning before the answer, but the auto-cleanup
profiles strip the `<think>` block cleanly from the result. So a thinking
model is just slower per enhance, not "leaky". Pick instruct for speed,
thinking for quality on harder rewrites.
* **VL is fine for text.** The enhancer only sends text, never images, so a
vision-language model's vision tower goes unused. That is harmless - the
well-maintained abliterated builds are usually VL. A text-only Qwen3-8B
abliterated GGUF works identically and saves the unused vision weight if
you prefer it.

> Tip: enhancer output targets ~900 characters. Z-Image Turbo and
> Qwen-Image-Edit begin losing prompt accuracy past roughly 1000 characters
> (the text encoder truncates or dilutes), so the enhancer aims just under
> that ceiling.

## Install

Install **Image Oasis** from ComfyUI Manager / the Comfy Registry, or place this
pack under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Image-Oasis/` and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI. The node appears under **Image Oasis → Image Oasis**.

### What `requirements.txt` installs

* **`spandrel`** + **`spandrel-extra-arches`** - model-based upscaling
(the Upscale section's "Model" mode). Algorithmic upscaling needs nothing.

### Optional dependencies (not in `requirements.txt`)

Image Oasis works without these - each missing dep just disables its specific
feature with a clear error at use-time, not at node-load.

* **`ComfyUI-GGUF`** - a separate ComfyUI custom node (not a pip package),
required for the GGUF source type and GGUF CLIP files. Install via ComfyUI
Manager (search "GGUF"). Without it, checkpoint and diffusion source types
still work; selecting GGUF errors clearly.

* **`llama-cpp-python`** - local LLM runtime for the prompt enhancer
("magic wand"). Kept out of `requirements.txt` because the CUDA install is
toolkit-specific.

  **Pre-built wheels (easiest)**:

  ```
  pip install llama-cpp-python                          # CPU only
  # CUDA wheels: use the abetlen llama-cpp-python wheel index for your toolkit
  # (cu121 / cu122 / cu124 / etc.) -- see that project's install docs.
  ```

  PyPI's stock wheel is CPU-only. The abetlen wheel index has CUDA-built wheels
per Python+CUDA combination - look up that project's install page for the
index URL matching your toolkit (cu121 / cu122 / cu124 / etc.).

  **Source build with CUDA (when no prebuilt wheel exists for your combo)**:

  ```
  set CMAKE_ARGS=-DGGML_CUDA=on
  set FORCE_CMAKE=1
  pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir llama-cpp-python
  ```

  This compiles from source - expect 15-30 minutes on a modern CPU. It requires:

  * **Visual Studio Build Tools** with the *Desktop development with C++*
workload (provides `cl.exe`). Free from Microsoft.
  * **CMake** on PATH (3.21 or newer).
  * **CUDA Toolkit** matching your driver (headers, libs, and `nvcc`).
Install from NVIDIA.

  On Linux, swap `set` for `export` and the rest is identical. On macOS, replace
`-DGGML_CUDA=on` with `-DGGML_METAL=on` for Apple Silicon GPU acceleration.

  **Heads up - bleeding-edge Python / CUDA**: if you're on a very new Python
(3.13+) or CUDA toolkit (13+), pre-built wheels may not exist yet. `pip install`
will silently fall back to a CPU-only source build *without* the CUDA flags
unless you set them explicitly. If your enhancer is suddenly slow after an
upgrade, check that the install built with CUDA - the build log near the end
should mention `GGML_CUDA` being enabled.

  **Flash attention is enabled by default** in the loader. Any reasonably
recent CUDA or Metal build of `llama-cpp-python` gets the speedup
transparently; CPU builds ignore the flag. Truly ancient versions (pre-0.2.51,
~2 years old) don't accept the `flash_attn` kwarg and will error on load -
upgrade if you see that.

## Notes

* Leave `clip_type` and `shift` neutral (blank / 0) to use the architecture's
defaults from the registry.
* Adding a new architecture later = one new entry in `registry.py` (set
`clip_slots` to 1, 2, or 3 to declare its CLIP arity).
* Preset state preserves CLIP slot 2 and 3 values across arch switches -
swap from SD3 to Qwen and back and your three SD3 CLIPs are still in
place. `nodes.py` trims unused slots before the load call, so a 1-slot
arch never accidentally triggers a triple-CLIP load with stale state.
