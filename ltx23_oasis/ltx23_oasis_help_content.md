# LTX2.3 Oasis 🌴

Everything works like Image Oasis. If you know IO, you already know this node. This page covers the video-specific parts and the reasoning behind the defaults.

## Quick start

1. **Model**: pick Diffusion or GGUF, select your LTX 2.3 model, both text encoders (Gemma-3 + text projection), and the video VAE. For sound, pick the audio VAE here and set **Audio** under Video / Audio to *Generate* (or *File* to drive the video from your own audio track).
2. **Prompt Enhancer**: Text → Video / Image → Video at the top sets both the pipeline and the enhancer style. Short idea in User Prompt, ✨ Enhance to expand it, or write straight into the Enhanced Prompt box. Negative Prompt sits under Enhance (same order as IO).
3. Press **▶** (keep seed) or **🎲** (randomize + generate) above the render pane. The timer runs while it cooks; **⏹** interrupts. Every render lands in the scene bar; click any thumbnail to bring it back.

## LoRAs

The IO stack, verbatim: **+ Add LoRA**, pick a file, set strength (text-encoder strength mirrors it behind the scenes). Drag the grip to reorder; they apply top to bottom. The ●/○ button toggles a LoRA without losing its settings. The **trigger words** field under each enabled LoRA is prepended to the positive prompt automatically (in stack order, comma-separated).

## The enhancer

✨ Enhance is powered by Image Oasis — same pack, always present — and shares IO's resident LLM (models go in `models/LLM`, GGUF). Pick the model in **Prompt Enhancer**; **Enhancer Settings** at the bottom of that section exposes Auto GPU layers (leave it on), context size, and max tokens. Enhance is disabled while a video is generating; loading the LLM mid-run would evict the diffusion model.

## Modes

- **Text → Video**: the prompt alone drives everything.
- **Image → Video**: a Start image becomes (approximately) the first frame. Drop or paste an image onto the thumbnail; dragging a render straight out of Image Oasis works. Loading an image into Start auto-selects this mode, and clearing the slot (✕) returns to Text → Video - the switch itself still works manually on top of that. You can also **drag the current frame out of this node's player** (pause/scrub to the frame you want, then drag the video onto Start or a beat guide slot).

### ↻ Continue from viewed video

Chains clips together in *any* mode, including T2V. **The tail source is whatever's in the viewer**: the next run starts from the last frame of the clip currently showing in the right pane. Click a different thumbnail in the scene bar and the next run continues from *that* clip instead. It overrides the Start slot while active.

Tick it once and keep hitting 🎲: each clip picks up where the viewed one ended, then becomes the viewed clip itself, so the chain walks forward automatically. Use 🎬 Create Movie (or any editor) to stitch the saved files afterwards.

Fidelity: continuing from the clip you *just generated* uses the exact frame tensor held in memory (lossless). Continuing from an older or loaded-from-disk clip extracts the frame from the encoded video, which costs one decode round-trip; in practice it's invisible.

A T2V run with Continue active silently becomes image-conditioned from the second run on. That's expected; it's how the chain works.

## Reference images

- **Start Frame**: the I2V anchor. The info line under the button shows resolution and file size; the ⤢ button copies the image's dimensions into Width/Height (snapped to /32, which LTX requires).

Keyframe guides live on **Prompt Beats** (their own section), not under references.

## Prompt Beats (multi-prompt + guides)

One timeline, one list. The **Enhanced Prompt** is the whole-clip description: subject, style, setting. Each **beat** is a stretch of time that can carry:

- **Local text**: what *happens* during that stretch (PromptRelay attention mask)
- **Guide image** (optional): a look/pose pinned at the **start** of that beat (`LTXVAddGuide`); strength under the thumb. Hover the thumb and click ✕ to clear it.

> Enhanced: *cinematic shot of a woman in a red coat inside a dim apartment, evening light*
> Beat 1: *she walks slowly toward the window* + start pose as guide
> Beat 2: *she opens the window and leans out into the rain* + end pose as guide

**Frames** on each beat sets duration. Leave every beat at 0 to split the video evenly. The meter under the beat list shows how your beats add up against the Video frame count: green = match, amber = short (frames past the last beat follow the Enhanced prompt alone, no local steering), red = over (beats past the video's end get truncated). When the sum doesn't match, **Match frames** sets Video frames to the beat sum (snapped to the LTX grid). Add as many beats as you need; there is no 3-guide hard limit (VRAM/latent size is the real constraint). Guide frames are cropped out after sampling and never appear literally in the output.

Tips: 2–3 beats for a 5-second clip is plenty; beats describe *actions*, not new scenes. Empty text with a guide is fine (guide-only beat). Empty guide with text is fine too.

## Video / Audio

- **Width / Height**: LTX wants multiples of 32; the ratio locks, ↔ swap, and ⤢ use-size all snap accordingly. Sweet spot with a reference image: render at **half the source image's resolution** (e.g. 1536×1536 source → 768×768 video), a clean 2:1 supersample.
- **Frames**: snaps to the LTX grid (8n+1: 97, 121, 145…). The ≈ seconds line updates live as you type.
- **FPS**: playback rate of the encoded file. LTX's native rhythm is 25.
- **Cond. FPS**: the frame rate stamped into the model's conditioning: how fast the model *thinks* time passes, independent of playback. 0 = follow FPS, which is right 95% of the time. The other 5%: conditioning 25 + encoding 12.5 = smooth slow motion; conditioning 25 now + RIFE-interpolating to 50 later keeps motion natural.
- **Audio**: three modes, all needing the Audio VAE under Model when not Off:
  - **Off**: silent video.
  - **Generate**: the model dreams the soundtrack from the prompt (describe the soundscape explicitly for best results).
  - **File**: *audio-driven video.* Upload or drop a real audio file; it's trimmed to the video's duration, encoded into the latent, and masked as fixed, so the model generates video that **matches your audio** (lip sync, singing, music-timed motion). The output muxes your original waveform (not a vocoder re-decode), so playback stays in sync with the frames. Longer files are trimmed; shorter files keep the original and generate the audio for the remaining tail.

## Generation

LTX 2.3 distilled samples on a fixed **sigma schedule** instead of a step count. The default list is the known-good template schedule (9 values ≈ 8 steps). Fewer values = faster and rougher; you can hand-edit the list. The ↺ button next to Sigmas restores the arch default. CFG stays at 1 for distilled models; raising it roughly doubles the time per step for usually-marginal benefit.

**Negative prompt** works in both regimes, through different plumbing. At CFG > 1 (base model territory) it's standard classifier-free guidance. At CFG 1 the sampler never runs an unconditional pass, so the node automatically routes the negative through **NAG** (Normalized Attention Guidance, KJNodes' LTX2 NAG; ComfyUI-KJNodes must be installed) which injects it directly into cross-attention. Leave the box empty and neither path activates.

Seed handling is IO's: the ▶/🎲 pair by the seed field and on the header, plus the After-gen control (fixed / increment / decrement / randomize).

## Upscale: Spatial Upsample (×2)

Runs the LTX 2× latent upsampler after the main sample. **Polish pass** additionally re-samples at the upscaled resolution: much sharper, but it runs the full diffusion model at 4× the tokens, so it's heavy (its re-noise sigma list is editable; ↺ resets it; fewer/lower values = subtler and faster). Off = upsample-only: fast, slightly softer. The sampled video is cached, so toggling Upscale re-runs only the upsample + decode, not the generation.

Off by default for two reasons: with a reference image active it can drift your subject's likeness, and the half-resolution-render + supersample route usually looks better anyway.

## The player & scene bar

Scrub bar with a frame counter, ▶/⏸ (Space), frame-step ⏮/⏭ (arrow keys; Shift = 1 second), mute, playback speed, and ⛶ lightbox (scroll = zoom, drag = pan, double-click = reset). Pause on any frame and **drag the video** onto Start or a beat guide to reuse that frame.

**Clip**: scrub to a frame and press **[** (mark in) then **]** (mark out), then **Clip**. That writes a trimmed copy under `output/video/clip_NNNNN.mp4` and adds it to the scene bar. Useful for keeping only the stretch you want before Create Movie.

The loop button cycles through three playback modes: **off → loop** (repeat the current clip) **→ cycle** (play through the scene bar clip after clip, a rolling dailies reel).

The **scene bar** keeps up to 24 renders, one click away, surviving tab switches and page reloads (saved entries also survive a ComfyUI restart; temp previews don't). The **+** tile loads any video from your `output/` folder into the bar. **💾 Save** (header button; hides when the pane is empty) copies the current preview losslessly into your output folder under your Save prefix. Scene ‹ n/m › nav sits in the info bar. A ✓ badge marks saved entries.

### 🎬 Create Movie

Concatenates every **saved** clip in the scene bar (left to right) into one file at `output/video/create_movie_NNNNN.mp4`. Clips must match resolution and FPS. When every clip shares the same bitstream params, video is stream-copied (lossless). If any clip differs (common after Clip, which re-encodes), the movie is re-encoded so the join stays clean. The 🔊/🔇 toggle controls audio: on, audio is re-encoded to AAC and silent clips get silence so the timeline stays aligned; off, the movie is silent.

## Encode

`auto` everything is a good default. webm accepts VP9/AV1 only; mp4 takes h264/hevc; mkv takes anything. Quality presets map to per-codec CRF values (codec scales differ, which is why presets rather than one raw number); `custom` exposes CRF directly. **Save prefix** sets where 💾 Save lands under `output/` and the filename stem (default `video/LTX23Oasis` → `output/video/LTX23Oasis_…`). Note hevc previews may not play in-browser; the file itself is fine.

## Presets & Theme

Presets capture the model/generation setup and **never** your prompts, seed, or reference images; loading one can't wipe in-progress work. Same cards, expand-for-details, and drag-to-reorder as IO, stored server-side under `user/ltx23_oasis/`. The Theme section edits **this node’s** palette (independent of Image Oasis) — and it also skins **Video Oasis Viewer**: the Viewer has no theme editor of its own and follows whatever palette you set here, so both nodes stay matched on the canvas.
