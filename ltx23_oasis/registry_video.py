"""
Architecture capability registry for LTX2.3 Oasis.

The video sibling of registry.py. Each entry declares how a video architecture
differs from the others: valid model sources, generation modes, text-encoder
layout, VAE slots, latent geometry rules (frame quantum / fps), the shape of
its sampling chain, and which optional subsystems it supports (PromptRelay
multi-prompt, keyframe guides, audio, native second-stage
upscale). Selecting an architecture selects a row here — the stages branch on
registry data, never on architecture name literals.

To add a new architecture later, add one entry. No new branching code required.

Where the numbers come from (source workflows the defaults were derived
from): LTX2_3_Custom.json (author's production workflow — distilled
single-stage) and video_ltx2_3_i2v.json (LTX dev template — two-stage; its
second stage informs the Upscale section defaults, which ship OFF).

`sampling` kinds (consumed by stage_sample_video.run_video_sampling_chain):
    distilled_manual_sigmas LTX 2.3 distilled: SamplerCustomAdvanced with an
                           explicit sigma list, CFG 1 (guider still CFGGuider
                           for uniformity). The sigma string is user-editable
                           in Generation; this row only supplies the default.
