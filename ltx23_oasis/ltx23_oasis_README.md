# LTX2.3 Oasis

Part of the **Oasis Suite** (Image Oasis v1.5+). Node class id: `LTX23Oasis`.
Frontend: [`../web/ltx23Oasis.js`](../web/ltx23Oasis.js). Suite overview:
[root README](../README.md).

All-in-one LTX 2.3 video generation in the Image Oasis UI shape. Encode, player,
scene bar, Clip, Create Movie, and Save go through the in-pack
**Video Oasis Viewer** path -- you do not need a separate video pack.

In-node Help is the same text as [`ltx23_oasis_help_content.md`](ltx23_oasis_help_content.md).

## Quick start

1. **Model**: pick Diffusion or GGUF, select your LTX 2.3 model, both text
   encoders (Gemma-3 + text projection), and the video VAE. For sound, pick the
   audio VAE and set **Audio** under Video / Audio to *Generate* (or *File* to
   drive the video from your own track).
2. **Prompt Enhancer**: Text → Video / Image → Video at the top sets both the
   pipeline and the enhancer style. Short idea in User Prompt, ✨ Enhance to
   expand it, or write straight into the Enhanced Prompt box. Negative Prompt
   sits under Enhance (same order as Image Oasis).
3. Press **▶** (keep seed) or **🎲** (randomize + generate). Every render lands
   in the scene bar; click any thumbnail to bring it back.

## Dependencies

| Need | Package / note |
|------|----------------|
| Required | This Oasis Suite pack (includes Video Oasis Viewer encode/player) |
| Optional | `ComfyUI-GGUF` for GGUF diffusion |
| Optional | `ComfyUI-KJNodes` for LTX2 NAG when CFG is 1 and a negative is set |
| Optional | `llama-cpp-python` (CUDA/Metal) for the GGUF prompt enhancer -- same as Image Oasis |

Presets and theme: `ComfyUI/user/ltx23_oasis/`. HTTP API: `/ltx23_oasis/*`
(Save and frame extraction ride the shared `/video_oasis/*` routes).

## LoRAs

Same stack as Image Oasis: **+ Add LoRA**, strength, drag to reorder, ●/○
toggle, optional **trigger words** prepended to the positive prompt.

## The enhancer

✨ Enhance is powered by Image Oasis's resident LLM (`models/LLM`, GGUF). Pick
the model under **Prompt Enhancer**; **Enhancer Settings** exposes Auto GPU
layers, context size, and max tokens. Enhance is disabled while a video is
generating so the LLM load cannot evict the diffusion model mid-run.

## Modes

- **Text → Video**: prompt alone.
- **Image → Video**: Start image ≈ first frame. Drop/paste onto the thumbnail;
  dragging a render from Image Oasis works. You can also **drag the current
  frame out of this node's player** onto Start, a beat guide, or any
  image input on the graph (Load Image, Image Oasis refs, ...).

### ↻ Continue from viewed video

Chains clips in *any* mode (including T2V). The next run starts from the **last
frame of whatever is in the viewer**. Click another scene-bar thumb and the
chain continues from that clip instead. Tick once and keep hitting 🎲 to walk
forward; stitch with 🎬 Create Movie afterwards.

Continuing from the clip you just generated uses the in-memory frame tensor
(lossless). Older / loaded-from-disk clips decode one frame from the file.

## Reference images

- **Start Frame**: I2V anchor. Info line shows resolution/size; ⤢ copies
  dimensions into Width/Height (snapped to /32).

Keyframe guides live under **Prompt Beats**, not under references.

## Prompt Beats (multi-prompt + guides)

The **Enhanced Prompt** is the whole-clip description. Each **beat** can carry:

- **Local text**: what happens during that stretch (PromptRelay attention mask)
- **Guide image** (optional): look/pose at the **start** of that beat
  (`LTXVAddGuide`); strength under the thumb

**Frames** on each beat sets duration. Leave every beat at 0 to split evenly.
The meter under the list: green = match, amber = short, red = over. **Match
frames** snaps Video frames to the beat sum. Guide frames are cropped out after
sampling and never appear literally in the output.

## Video / Audio

- **Width / Height**: multiples of 32; ratio lock, ↔ swap, ⤢ use-size snap.
  Sweet spot with a reference: render at **half** the source resolution.
- **Frames**: LTX grid (8n+1). ≈ seconds updates live.
- **FPS**: playback rate of the encoded file (native rhythm is 25).
- **Cond. FPS**: how fast the model *thinks* time passes; `0` = follow FPS.
- **Audio** (needs Audio VAE when not Off):
  - **Off** -- silent
  - **Generate** -- soundtrack from the prompt
  - **File** -- audio-driven video; your waveform is muxed back (not vocoder-decoded)

## Generation

LTX 2.3 distilled uses a fixed **sigma schedule** (default ~9 values ≈ 8 steps).
↺ restores the arch default. CFG stays at 1 for distilled models.

**Negative prompt**: at CFG > 1, standard CFG; at CFG 1 the node routes through
**NAG** (KJNodes LTX2 NAG). Empty negative = neither path.

Seed: ▶/🎲 by the seed field and header, plus After-gen
(fixed / increment / decrement / randomize).

## Upscale: Spatial Upsample (×2)

LTX 2× latent upsampler after the main sample. **Polish pass** re-samples at
the upscaled resolution (heavy). Sampled video is cached -- toggling Upscale
re-runs only upsample + decode. Off by default (likeness drift with refs; half-res
+ supersample often looks better).

## Player & scene bar

Same toolkit as [Video Oasis Viewer](../video_oasis/video_oasis_README.md):

- Scrub, Space, arrows, mute, speed, lightbox
- Drag the paused frame onto Start, a beat guide, or any image input on
  the graph
- **Clip** (`[` / `]` then Clip)
- Loop: off → loop → cycle
- Scene bar (≤24), **+** load from output, **Save** (header; hides when empty)
- History survives tab switches and reloads (temps pruned after Comfy restart)

### 🎬 Create Movie

Concatenates every **saved** scene-bar clip into
`output/video/create_movie_NNNNN.mp4`. Stream-copy when params match;
re-encode when needed (common after Clip). Audio toggle pads silence so the
timeline stays aligned.

## Encode

`auto` defaults are fine. webm → VP9/AV1; mp4 → h264/hevc; mkv → anything.
Quality presets map to per-codec CRF; `custom` exposes CRF. **Save prefix**
defaults to `video/LTX23Oasis`. HEVC may not preview in-browser.

## Presets & Theme

Presets capture model/generation setup -- **never** prompts, seed, or reference
images. Stored under `user/ltx23_oasis/`. Theme edits **this node's** palette
(independent of Image Oasis).

## Vendored code

PromptRelay / patches from WhatDreamsCost-ComfyUI (LTX Director) live under
`vendor/` and require **GPL-3.0-or-later** for the pack. See
