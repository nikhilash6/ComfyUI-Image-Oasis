"""
Image Oasis — "magic wand" prompt enhancer (backend route).

A self-contained, out-of-band prompt enhancer. It is NOT part of the generation
pipeline: the JS wand button POSTs the current user prompt + a style toggle here,
this route loads a local GGUF LLM, expands the prompt, and returns the text. The
LLM stays loaded between clicks; the diffusion generation pipeline calls
`unload_enhancer()` at the top of stage_load so the LLM never competes with the
diffusion model during sampling.

Implements:
  - profile-based cleanup (auto-resolves from model filename → regex rules)
  - two system prompts (Natural Language / Tags)
  - llama-cpp-python load + chat-completion call (single message pair, no
    [OUTPUT] wrapping, no think suppression — those are the model's job via the
    system prompt)
  - auto GPU-layer sizing from the GGUF header + live free VRAM
  - a *targeted* VRAM free (comfy free_memory) that preserves Image Oasis's
    own load cache when there is already room, rather than a blanket unload
  - OOM-on-load -> CPU retry fallback
